#isEmpty jQuery Plugin

isEmpty is a simple jQuery plugin that temporarily hides error styling on required form fields. I don't think it's cool to tell a user they're doing it wrong before they've had a chance to actually do anything.

Further documentation, and a demo, is available over on [my site](http://davidturner.name/releases/is-empty/).
